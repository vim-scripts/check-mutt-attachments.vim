When using Vim to write an email from say Mutt, one can mention things like "I am attaching the email I was telling you about" and then forget to attach it.

This script prompts the user when exiting Vim pointing out that an attachment is mentioned in the message, and that may require something attached to the message.

This implements a suggestion made at: http://groups.google.fr/groups?hl=fr&lr=&ie=UTF-8&selm=caq406%24rq4%241%40FreeBSD.csie.NCTU.edu.tw
